# Welcome to BadgerDAO - Subgraph Wiki

```
Important things...
Tokens - 4 of them - Track Transfers.
Geyser - 11 of them - Tracks Stacked and UnStake Events.
Sett - 20 of them (13 old + 7 new) - Transfer Event does something we are interested in...
Harvest/Strategy - (13 old + 7 new + 1 experimental) - HarvestState does something that we are interested in...
Fees - Specific Transfers from Strategies to BadgerDAO.
```

Geysers are correct
Setts are correct (less contract abi, but we don't use V3/V4 features)
TODO: Harvest/Strategy are missing quite abit
TODO: Tokens are missing bBadger and bDigg
